### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month of May has the most successful launches, while December has the least. In addition, May also has the highest percentage of successful launches.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Goal bands less than $5000 were the most successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible challenges and difficulties that may be encountered are incorrect formulas for the outcomes based on goal deliverable. Incorrect conclusions reached based on the charts not having the correct x and y axis chosen.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month of May is the best month to launch and the December is the worst month to launch
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals under $5000 are more likely to be successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It has limited sample size and there are some data missing from the initial kickstarter sheet. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create a stacked bar graph for the months for the outcomes based on launch date.
